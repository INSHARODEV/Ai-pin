# Project Setup

## Backend

1. Navigate to the backend folder:
   ```bash
   cd backend
````

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

## Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend folder:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

```

This format is clean, easy to follow, and works well in a `README.md` file.  

I can also add **prerequisites** (like Node version) and **environment variable instructions** if you want it to be a full setup guide. Do you want me to do that?
